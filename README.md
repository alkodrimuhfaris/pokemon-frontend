This is the repository for a simple Pokémon game, the game is built on ReactJS (React 17), with React Router as a router
In this app, you can collect, release, and rename a pokémon. This game is based on [Poké API v2](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)

This app uses redux as a state manager, for styling we use Reactstrap and SASS
